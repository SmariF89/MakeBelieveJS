# MakeBelieveJS
A jQuery-like JavaScript library which enables an easy DOM manipulation using clever HTML element querying.

This library was written as a general exercise in JavaScript along with learning how to use JavaScript to manipulate HTML documents - not unlike how jQuery does. The library also contains a simple AJAX functionality which allows developers to make XMLHttpRequests.
